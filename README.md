# todo Project

## How does it function?

- User can write todo items in an input, and can add the items to an array by clicking the “Add” button.

- Every time user adds an item, all the items are displayed on the screen, the latest one on top.

- User can change the status of the items from undone to done or vice versa, just by clicking on them. Done items show up with a tick sign at the beginning and struck through.

- User can delete any item at any time by clicking on the trash bin on the right side of each row.
